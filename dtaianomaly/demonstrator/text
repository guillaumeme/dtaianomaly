1. Activate the Virtual Environment
Make sure your virtual environment is active before installing packages or running the script:
bash

source X/PycharmProjects/dtaianomaly/venv/bin/activate

After activation, your terminal prompt should show (venv) at the beginning.
2. Install Streamlit in the Virtual Environment
Since Streamlit is currently installed in Anaconda but not in your venv, install it in the virtual environment:
bash

pip install streamlit

This ensures Streamlit is available in ./venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages.
3. Verify Package Installations
Check Streamlit's installation:

bash

pip show streamlit


Confirm dtaianomaly is installed :
bash

pip show dtaianomaly

This should also point to ./venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages.

4. Run the Script
With the virtual environment activated and all dependencies installed, run your script:
bash


streamlit run X/PycharmProjects/dtaianomaly/dtaianomaly/demonstrator/Demonstrator.py
