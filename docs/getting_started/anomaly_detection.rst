Anomaly detection
=================

The core functionality of ``dtaianomaly`` is to offer a simple interface
for time series anomaly detection. Below, we illustrate how anomalies can
be detected in time series using ``dtaianomaly``.

.. note::
    Some of the code has not been added to this webpage for clarity reasons. The full
    code can be found in the `anomaly detection notebook <https://github.com/ML-KULeuven/dtaianomaly/blob/main/notebooks/Anomaly-detection.ipynb>`_.

.. note::
    Below example illustrates how to detect anomalies in a simple demonstration time
    series. It is also possible to use ``dtaianomaly`` in industrial datasets, as is
    shown in the `industrial anomaly detection notebook <https://github.com/ML-KULeuven/dtaianomaly/blob/main/notebooks/Industrial-anomaly-detection.ipynb>`_.


Load the data
-------------

We will illustrate how to detect anomalies with ``dtaianomaly`` using the
demonstration time series. This time series can easily be loaded using the
:py:func:`~dtaianomaly.data.demonstration_time_series` method and then plotted
using the :py:func:`~dtaianomaly.visualization.plot_time_series_colored_by_score`
method.

.. code-block:: python

    from dtaianomaly.data import demonstration_time_series
    from dtaianomaly.visualization import plot_time_series_colored_by_score
    X, y = demonstration_time_series()
    plot_time_series_colored_by_score(X, y, figsize=(10, 2))

Anomaly detection
-----------------

Before detecting anomalies, we can preprocess the time series. In this case,
we apply :py:class:`~dtaianomaly.preprocessing.MovingAverage` to remove some
of the noise from the time series.

.. code-block:: python

    from dtaianomaly.preprocessing import MovingAverage
    preprocessor = MovingAverage(window_size=10)

In general, `any anomaly detector <https://dtaianomaly.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/anomaly_detection.html>`_
in ``dtaianomaly`` can be used to detect anomalies in this time series. Here, we use the
:py:class:`~dtaianomaly.anomaly_detection.MatrixProfileDetector`

.. code-block:: python

    from dtaianomaly.anomaly_detection import MatrixProfileDetector
    detector = MatrixProfileDetector(window_size=100)


Now that the components have been initialized, we can preprocess the time series and
detect anomalies. Note that the preprocessor returns two values, processed data ``X_``
and processed ground truth ``y_``. While :py:class:`~dtaianomaly.preprocessing.MovingAverage`
does not process the ground truth, other preprocessors may change the ground truth slightly.
For example, :py:class:`~dtaianomaly.preprocessing.SamplingRateUnderSampler` samples both
the time series ``X`` and labels ``y``.

.. code-block:: python

    X_, y_ = preprocessor.fit_transform(X)
    y_pred = detector.fit(X_).predict_proba(X_)

Now we can plot the data along with the anomaly scores, and see that the predictions
nicely align with the anomaly!

Anomaly detection with a Pipeline
---------------------------------

Above, we manually preprocessed the data and detected anomalies within the processed
data. In ``dtaianomaly``, these steps can be performed automatically using a
:py:class:`~dtaianomaly.pipeline.Pipeline`. Upon initialization, we simply pass the
preprocessors we want to apply, as well as the detector. The fit and predict methods
will automatically process the data before detecting anomalies. Note that it is also
possible to pass a list of preprocessors to apply multiple preprocessing steps before
detecting anomalies.

.. code-block:: python

    from dtaianomaly.pipeline import Pipeline
    pipeline = Pipeline(
        preprocessor=preprocessor,
        detector=detector
    )
    y_pred = pipeline.fit(X).predict_proba(X)

Quantitative evaluation
-----------------------

Besides visually checking the performance of an anomaly detector, it is also important
to quantitatively measure how accurately the anomalies are detected. Below, we first
compute the :py:class:`~dtaianomaly.evaluation.Precision` and :py:class:`~dtaianomaly.evaluation.Recall`.
However, that the precision and recall require binary labels, while the predicted anomaly
scores are continuous. For this reason, we apply :py:class:`~dtaianomaly.thresholding.FixedCutoff`
thresholding to convert all scores above 0.85 to 1 ("anomaly") and the scores below 0.85
to 0 ("normal"). At this threshold, we see that all anomalous observations are detected
(recall=1.0), at the cost of some false positives near the borders of the ground truth
anomaly (precision<1).

.. code-block:: python

    from dtaianomaly.thresholding import FixedCutoff
    from dtaianomaly.evaluation import Precision, Recall
    thresholding = FixedCutoff(0.85)
    y_pred_binary = thresholding.threshold(y_pred)
    precision = Precision().compute(y, y_pred_binary)
    recall = Recall().compute(y, y_pred_binary)


Alternatively to manually applying a threshold to convert the continuous scores to
binary predictions, you can initialize a :py:class:`~dtaianomaly.evaluation.ThresholdMetric`,
which will automatically apply a specified thresholding strategy before using a binary
evaluation metric. Below, we use the same thresholding as above, but compute the
:py:class:`~dtaianomaly.evaluation.FBeta` score with :math:`\\beta = 1`.

.. code-block:: python

    from dtaianomaly.evaluation import ThresholdMetric, FBeta
    f_1 = ThresholdMetric(thresholding, FBeta(1.0)).compute(y, y_pred)

Lastly, we also compute the :py:class:`~dtaianomaly.evaluation.AreaUnderROC` and
:py:class:`~dtaianomaly.evaluation.AreaUnderPR`. Because these metrics create a
curve for all possible thresholds, we can simply pass the predicted, continuous
anomaly scores, as shown below.

.. code-block:: python

    from dtaianomaly.evaluation import AreaUnderROC, AreaUnderPR
    auc_roc = AreaUnderROC().compute(y, y_pred)
    auc_pr = AreaUnderPR().compute(y, y_pred)

The table below shows the computed performance metrics for this example.
